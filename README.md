# Challenge_11
This challenge was completed with some help from tutors.
The part that I recieved the most assitance with was Step 5 of the Mars Weather Analysis where we calculated how many earth days are on Mars. I understand the process now.
I also recieved a little help writing the for loop in the Mars News part of the challenge. Mostly I was missing the [0] indexes.
